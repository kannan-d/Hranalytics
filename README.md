A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company. Since the attrition level is too high, the management wants to use predictive modelling to bring it down.
 
Hence, the objectives of the analysis are to:
Help company XYZ identify current employees that are very likely to leave
Recommend ways for company XYZ to decrease its attrition level in the future

The analysis is divided into three parts:
Data Understanding – Source of data, patterns in the data
Predictive modelling of attrition
Recommending ways for company XYZ to decrease its level of attrition
